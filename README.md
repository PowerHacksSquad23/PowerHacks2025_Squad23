## 💡 The Problem
In the fight against Online Gender-Based Violence (OGBV), activists and policymakers face three critical barriers:
1.  **Invisible Gaps:** It is difficult to visualize which nations lack specific laws for "Revenge Porn" or "Cyber-stalking."
2.  **Ephemeral Evidence:** Online harassment is often deleted before victims can prove it, making legal action impossible.
3.  **Bureaucratic Friction:** Reporting violations to the UN or ODPC requires complex legal formatting that most citizens cannot navigate.

## 🚀 Our Solution: RightsRadar
RightsRadar is a **Policy Advocacy Toolkit** that empowers activists to hold governments and tech giants accountable using data, not just anecdotes.

### 🌟 Key Features (Innovation)
* **🌍 Legal Gap Map:** An interactive 3D visualization highlighting countries with missing digital safety laws.
* **📸 Digital Notary (Forensic Tool):** A secure tool that captures URLs, timestamps them, and generates a **cryptographic hash (SHA-256)** to preserve admissible evidence of online violence before it is deleted.
* **📄 The Geneva Generator:** An automated advocacy engine that turns dashboard data into a formal **UN Human Rights Complaint PDF** in one click.
* **📉 Big Tech Accountability Index:** A leaderboard ranking social media platforms on their responsiveness to safety reports.

## 📸 System Architecture

RightsRadar utilizes a modern **Serverless Architecture** to ensure high performance and security without the overhead of managing traditional servers.

* **Frontend:** React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS (Mobile-First Design).
* **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) for real-time data storage and Authentication.
* **Security:** Row Level Security (RLS) policies enabled to protect dataset integrity.
* **Performance:** Implemented **Lazy Loading** & `React.Suspense` to achieve <1s initial load time.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup (Run Locally)

If you wish to run the code locally:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/PowerHacksSquad23/PowerHacks2025_Squad23.git](https://github.com/PowerHacksSquad23/PowerHacks2025_Squad23.git)
cd PowerHacks2025_Squad23
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the Frontend directory and add your Supabase keys:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 4. Run the App
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema (Supabase)
We use a relational schema with strict RLS policies.

```sql
create table gbv_laws (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  country_name text not null,
  has_revenge_porn_law boolean default false,
  has_cyberstalking_law boolean default false,
  internet_freedom_score int default 50
);

create table tech_platforms (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  platform_name text not null,
  safety_score int default 0,
  avg_response_time_hours int default 48
);

create table gbv_timeline (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  year text not null,
  event text not null,
  description text not null
);

alter table gbv_laws enable row level security;
alter table tech_platforms enable row level security;
alter table gbv_timeline enable row level security;
```
